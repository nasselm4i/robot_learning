## Execution Instructions

Follow these steps to execute the `all_experiments.sh` script:

1. Ensure that you have followed all the steps in the `installation.md` file. This file contains all the necessary setup and installation instructions for the project.

2. Open the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code. You can do this by clicking on `View` in the menu, then `Terminal`, or by using the shortcut `Ctrl+` backtick.

3. Before executing the script, ensure it has the necessary permissions. You can do this with the `chmod` command. Type `chmod +x all_experiments.sh` and press enter. This will make the script executable.

3. Now you can execute the script. Type `./all_experiments.sh` and press enter. The script should now run, and you will see the output in the terminal.

Here's how these steps would look in the terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to the directory containing the script
cd path/to/directory

# Make the script executable
chmod +x all_experiments.sh

# Execute the script
./all_experiments.sh
